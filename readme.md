### Hello there! 😉

**IMPORTANT!**  I've moved away from Github and my projects are now hosted on my own [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org) Instance <https://code.lila.network/adoras-projects>. See https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2022/jun/30/give-up-github-launch/ for the reasons as to why I left GitHub.

Hi I'm Adora, a german Site Reliability Engineer, Go Developer and Network Engineer!

I'm looking to deepen my Go and Kubernetes knowledge and grow more into getting proficient with common software development practises.
